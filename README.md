# Procom-Coding-Exercise

procom-coding-exercise

This is the repo for the solutions of the Procomo Coding Exercise.
There are 2 folders, functionality, and react-web-app. On the functionality folder we have the base TS and node solution to the exercise and on react-web-app folder we have the UI challenge.

How to run this app:

0 These steps assume you've already set up Node in your computer, if you haven't check out https://nodejs.org/ \
1 Open a terminal in your system. \
2 Go to the folder where you've cloned the project. \
3 Run 'npm run run-all', this step will install all dependecies on both folders and run them. \
3.1 If dependecies have already been installed we can run 'npm run exercise' to get the results. \

Expected results:

1. From the functionality folder's script we'll get an output to the console with the active records being displayed and the array of objects printed by Name order.
2. From the app in react-web-app, we will have it running on port 3000 which we can access it on http://localhost:3000/
